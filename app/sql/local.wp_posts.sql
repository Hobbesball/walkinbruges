The city’s medieval street pattern stayed for the most part unchanged, creating a peculiar\r\nand authentic atmosphere, where small winding cobblestone streets connect picturesque squares,\r\nlined with stepped gable houses, city palaces and gothic churches. The horse drawn carriages and\r\nboats on the canals make the picture complete. We visit the Lake of Love, the Beguinage, the\r\nchurch of Our Lady (outside), the Saint-Johns hospital (outside), Gruuthuse palace (outside), the\r\nmany canals and bridges, the Burg, the central market place with the Belfry, the Jan van Eyck\r\nsquare, and many more. The history of medieval Bruges unfolds during the walk, and is spiced up\r\nwith many entertaining tales that make the city of Bruges in the Middle Ages come to life for you,\r\nwhere the rich lived in the Golden Ages, but the poor more often in de Dark Ages. The walk can be\r\npersonalized to your taste or specific interests. We can extend the walk to a half day tour that\r\nincludes extras like a boat tour, a museum visit, a brewery visit, a visit of a local bar to try some\r\nlocal beers…","The Golden Dark Ages: highlights of Bruges","","publish","open","closed","","the-golden-dark-ages-highlights-of-bruges","","","2019-08-27 18:24:24","2019-08-27 18:24:24","",0,"http://walk-in-bruges.local/?post_type=itineraries&#038;p=35",0,"itineraries","",0),
