I\'m Veerle. I\'ve been living in Bruges for over a decade, and I know the city inside and out. Come discover Bruges with me!\n\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div></div>\n<!-- /wp:media-text -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The beautiful and romantic city of Bruges is my hometown. Every time I see the amazement in the eyes of the tourists visiting the city I feel privileged to live here. We live just outside \'the Kruispoort\', and whenever the weather permits, we walk through Bruges as if it were our personal garden of Versailles. I love to wander along its small streets and still discover new spots in unexpected corners. I am an avid traveller myself who loves to discover new places and is always looking for an authentic local experience. So whenever friends visit Bruges the tourist guide in me pops out. I love to show our visitors the historic beauty and all the cultural riches that Bruges holds within its old ramparts. I love to show them the quiet cobblestone streets with the stepped gable houses, the many almshouses around the beautiful gardens, the more than 300 Lady Mary statues that grace the facades, the many parks that bring nature into the inner city and the labyrinth of canals that branded Bruges the \'Venice of the North\'. Only at the end of our walk will I immerse my friends into the crowded bustling city centre we\'ve nicknamed \'the golden triangle\'. Here they come eye to eye with the grand medieval buildings and awe inspiring sights that made our city earn its Cultural Heritage status. Bruges is however more than \'the Belfry\', the \'church of Our Lady\', the \'Gruuthuuse palace\', and the architectural gem that is \'The Burg\'. Bruges is most above all a city that exhumes a serene atmosphere that is not always easily translated into words but always leaves visitors elated and enriched.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I love to share my enthusiasm with visitors who want to experience Bruges. I hence decided to enroll in a four year study program to become a professional tour and city guide. I am still studying and probably always will be. I am now registered as a licensed city tour guide and eager to show you the exceptional beauty of my city. I can show you all the postcard highlights, let you discover the romantic backstreets we locals cherish and give you a peek into some of its less explored gems that witness of its medieval history. I can take you on bike rides around the green ramparts of Bruges and guide you along the canal towards the nearby picturesque village called Damme and its green surroundings.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Beside helping you to explore the sights and sounds of this fascinating ancient Hanze city I\'ll also happily introduce you into our local culinary heritage and give you a taste of Bruges relationship with beer and chocolate.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can contact me by e-mail: hello@walkinbruges.be and I will be happy to create some unforgettable memories for you during your stay in Bruges.

(35,1,"2019-08-27 18:21:30","2019-08-27 18:21:30","A walk through medieval Bruges, visiting all the highlights that stand testimony to the Golden Ages\r\nbetween the 13th and 15th century, when Brugge was the economical capital of North-Western\r\nEurope. The city’s medieval street pattern stayed for the most part unchanged, creating a peculiar\r\nand authentic atmosphere, where small winding cobblestone streets connect picturesque squares,\r\nlined with stepped gable houses, city palaces and gothic churches. The horse drawn carriages and\r\nboats on the canals make the picture complete. We visit the Lake of Love, the Beguinage, the\r\nchurch of Our Lady (outside), the Saint-Johns hospital (outside), Gruuthuse palace (outside), the\r\nmany canals and bridges, the Burg, the central market place with the Belfry, the Jan van Eyck\r\nsquare, and many more. The history of medieval Bruges unfolds during the walk, and is spiced up\r\nwith many entertaining tales that make the city of Bruges in the Middle Ages come to life for you,\r\nwhere the rich lived in the Golden Ages, but the poor more often in de Dark Ages. The walk can be\r\npersonalized to your taste or specific interests. We can extend the walk to a half day tour that\r\nincludes extras like a boat tour, a museum visit, a brewery visit, a visit of a local bar to try some\r\nlocal beers…","The Golden Dark Ages: highlights of Bruges","","publish","open","closed","","the-golden-dark-ages-highlights-of-bruges","","","2019-08-27 18:24:24","2019-08-27 18:24:24","",0,"http://walk-in-bruges.local/?post_type=itineraries&#038;p=35",0,"itineraries","",0),

Come discover Bruges with me!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The beautiful and romantic city of Bruges is my hometown. Every time I see the amazement in the eyes of the tourists visiting the city I feel privileged to live here. We live just outside \'the Kruispoort\', and whenever the weather permits, we walk through Bruges as if it were our personal garden of Versailles. I love to wander along its small streets and still discover new spots in unexpected corners. I am an avid traveller myself who loves to discover new places and is always looking for an authentic local experience. So whenever friends visit Bruges the tourist guide in me pops out. I love to show our visitors the historic beauty and all the cultural riches that Bruges holds within its old ramparts. I love to show them the quiet cobblestone streets with the stepped gable houses, the many almshouses around the beautiful gardens, the more than 300 Lady Mary statues that grace the facades, the many parks that bring nature into the inner city and the labyrinth of canals that branded Bruges the \'Venice of the North\'. Only at the end of our walk will I immerse my friends into the crowded bustling city centre we\'ve nicknamed \'the golden triangle\'. Here they come eye to eye with the grand medieval buildings and awe inspiring sights that made our city earn its Cultural Heritage status. Bruges is however more than \'the Belfry\', the \'church of Our Lady\', the \'Gruuthuuse palace\', and the architectural gem that is \'The Burg\'. Bruges is most above all a city that exhumes a serene atmosphere that is not always easily translated into words but always leaves visitors elated and enriched. <br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I love to share my enthusiasm with visitors who want to experience Bruges. I hence decided to enroll in a four year study program to become a professional tour and city guide. I am still studying and probably always will be. I am now registered as a licensed city tour guide and eager to show you the exceptional beauty of my city. I can show you all the postcard highlights, let you discover the romantic backstreets we locals cherish and give you a peek into some of its less explored gems that witness of its medieval history. I can take you on bike rides around the green ramparts of Bruges and guide you along the canal towards the nearby picturesque village called Damme and its green surroundings.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Beside helping you to explore the sights and sounds of this fascinating ancient Hanze city I\'ll also happily introduce you into our local culinary heritage and give you a taste of Bruges relationship with beer and chocolate.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can contact me by e-mail: hello@walkinbruges.be and I will be happy to create some unforgettable memories for you during your stay in Bruges.

The city’s medieval street pattern stayed for the most part unchanged, creating a peculiar\r\nand authentic atmosphere, where small winding cobblestone streets connect picturesque squares,\r\nlined with stepped gable houses, city palaces and gothic churches. The horse drawn carriages and\r\nboats on the canals make the picture complete. We visit the Lake of Love, the Beguinage, the\r\nchurch of Our Lady (outside), the Saint-Johns hospital (outside), Gruuthuse palace (outside), the\r\nmany canals and bridges, the Burg, the central market place with the Belfry, the Jan van Eyck\r\nsquare, and many more. The history of medieval Bruges unfolds during the walk, and is spiced up\r\nwith many entertaining tales that make the city of Bruges in the Middle Ages come to life for you,\r\nwhere the rich lived in the Golden Ages, but the poor more often in de Dark Ages. The walk can be\r\npersonalized to your taste or specific interests.
